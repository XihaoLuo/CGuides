COMS W4170: User Interface Design Final Project
Fall 2020

Author: Xihao  Luo (Part of a team project but I did the implementation by myself.)

This project is a design project that explores the idea of designing a website that aggregates study guides for Columbia students.
The implementation here is only the front-end using static HTML/CSS webpages.
